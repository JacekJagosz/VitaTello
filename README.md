VitaTello
=================
 
 What does this do?
===================
 
  This is meant to become a remote control app for PS Vita.
  It currently can fly Tello using analog sticks, takeoff(X), land(O) and turn off the engines in case of emergency (â–³).
  You can also change speed to 5m/s (SELECT - default) and 10m/s (START).
  UDP communication is based on psxdev's [debugnet](https://github.com/psxdev/debugnet).
  
  More to come! (hopefully)
